# Three Ways to See What Enzyme Is Rendering in React Unit Tests

This is sample code to accompany the blog post @ https://wleecarter.com/post/three-ways-to-see-what-enzyme-is-rendering

## To Install
`npm install`

## To Run Tests
`npm test`

or

`npm run "test:watch"`

Note: One of the four tests will fail by design - the failing test is used to illustrate chai-enzyme's debug output 
in assertion exceptions.
